i have learned to make a resposinve banking UI with deposit/withdraw buttons and diplay the balance of the deposit entered by the user 
i have leaned about the box model use in the experiment use of paddding and margin border content
i have leaned about the use of diffrent colurs in backgorunf using style csss 
i have leaned about the structuring and aligning the box column and the spacing between them
i have added the diffrent colours boxes for the deposit and withdraw which helps to diffrentiate the between them and make them out to see them in the box
i have also added the shadow for the boxes when the cursor move on them
