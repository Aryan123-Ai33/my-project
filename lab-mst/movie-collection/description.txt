Experiment: Movie Collection App using React

In this experiment, I created a simple Movie Collection app using React and Vite.
The goal was to build a frontend application where users can manage their personal movie collection by adding and removing movies.

I started by setting up a new React project with Vite, which made it easy to get started quickly.
 Then, I created a Collection component that handles the main functionality.

The app uses React's useState hook to manage the list of movies and the form inputs. 
Each movie has an id, title, genre, and rating. I initialized the state with two sample movies: "Conjuring" (Horror, 7.9) and "Interstellar" (Sci-Fi, 8.6).

For adding movies, I made a form with inputs for title, genre, and rating. 
When the user submits the form, it validates the inputs (rating must be a number between 0 and 10) and adds the new movie to the list. 
The form clears after adding.

To display the movies, I used a list where each movie shows its details and a remove button. 
Clicking remove deletes that movie from the collection.

I learned how to handle forms in React, manage state with hooks, and perform basic validation. 
Also, I got better at structuring components and using event handlers.

To run the app, I used npm install to install dependencies, then npm run dev to start the development server. 
The app opens in the browser and works interactively.

This experiment helped me understand building simple CRUD operations in a React frontend without a backend.
