# TODO for Improving CSS in Auth Context App

- [x] Update App.css with modern, responsive styles for the auth app:
  - Center the layout using flexbox.
  - Style the login form with a card-like design, including input fields and button.
  - Style the dashboard with welcome message and logout button.
  - Use a blue color scheme, add hover effects, padding, and margins for better UX.
  - Ensure responsiveness with media queries if needed.

- [x] Update Login.jsx and Dashboard.jsx to use the new CSS classes.

- [x] Run the app to test the new styles.
