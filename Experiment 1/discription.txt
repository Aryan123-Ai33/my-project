I learned how to create a simple student registration form using HTML5. In the form, I used different input types like text for the name, email for the email address, and number for the age. I also added simple validation to make sure the user fills in the boxes correctly. For example the name must have at least 2 letters but no more than 30 the email has to a real email and the age should be between 1 and 25. If something is blank or wrong written in the boxes, the browser shows message to fix it then you can sumbit or register it .
